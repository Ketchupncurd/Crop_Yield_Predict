## Project Overview

Crop yield depends on a variety of factors such as soil nutrients, environmental conditions, and pest incidence. This project leverages historical agricultural data to predict crop yields efficiently. Using a **LightGBM regression model**, the app provides accurate yield predictions given user inputs.

The app is deployed on **Streamlit Community Cloud**, allowing anyone to access and use it via a browser.

## Features

- Predict crop yield based on:
  - Soil nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium)
  - Fertilizer application (Urea, DAP, Potash)
  - Area under cultivation
  - Pest incidence score
  - Year and other relevant factors
- Interactive web interface for easy input
- Visual display of predicted crop yield
- Supports multiple crops (if dataset includes them)
- **(From App Code):** Visual display of model **Feature Importances** for transparency.

## Dataset

The app uses a curated agricultural dataset containing:

| Column Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Year` | Year of cultivation |
| `Area_Hectares` | Area of cultivation in hectares |
| `Nitrogen_KgPerHa` | Nitrogen content per hectare |
| `Phosphorus_KgPerHa` | Phosphorus content per hectare |
| `Potassium_KgPerHa` | Potassium content per hectare |
| `Pest_Incidence_Score` | Pest incidence score (0â€“10) |
| `Urea_Applied_KgPerHa` | Urea fertilizer applied per hectare |
| `DAP_Applied_KgPerHa` | DAP fertilizer applied per hectare |
| `Potash_Applied_KgPerHa` | Potash fertilizer applied per hectare |
| `Crop_Yield` | Target variable (Yield in Kg/Ha) |

> The dataset should be placed locally and used to train the model if you want to retrain it.

## Model

- **Algorithm**: LightGBM Regressor
- **Purpose**: Predict crop yield based on multiple features
- **Artifacts Required**:
  - `lgbm_model.joblib` â†’ Trained model
  - `label_encoders.joblib` â†’ Encoders for categorical variables
  - `features_list.joblib` â†’ List of features used in the model

The model is pre-trained and loaded when the app starts.
